# discordia-reaction-menu

This is a simple reaction menu library for Discordia that I use in a couple of my bots.

This library **may change at any time without notice**. Since it's not on lit (yet), I'm not going to provide version numbers. The library is only on Github so that I can create docs for it, and in case someone wants to use it. It may be unstable. Use at your own risk.

## Dependencies
* [Luvit](https://luvit.io/)
* [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/)

## Installation
Add `discordia-reaction-menu.lua` to your `deps/` or `libs/` folder in your bot. I do this using a hard link to the cloned repo, for easy pushing/pulling.

## Usage
See this repo's wiki.
